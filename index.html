    <div What is Git>
   <h1><b>What is Git?</b></h1>
   <p><em><b>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files</em></b>, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing
     source code during software development. Git's goals include speed, data integrity, 
     and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p> 
     <p><b>A version Control System </b> is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of
         computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source 
         code during software development. Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
         non-linear workflows.</p>
         <p><u>Other version control systems like Git are:</u>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Bazaar-</b>Bazaar is a version control system that helps you track project history over time 
                and to collaborate easily with others. </li><br>
                <li><b>CVS-</b>CVS is a version control system, an important component of Source Configuration Management (SCM). 
                    Using it, you can record the history of sources files, and documents.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Mercurial-</b>Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. 
                        It efficiently handles projects of any size and offers an easy and intuitive interface.</li><br>

                             host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories. You can use CodeCommit 
                            to securely store anything from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <p><b> Reasons for Focus on git and Github:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Distributed Development:</b> Git is a distributed version control system, meaning every user has a complete 
                                copy of the repository. This enables 
                                developers to work offline, commit changes locally, and collaborate seamlessly across different locations.</li>
                                <li><b>Speed and Efficiency:</b> Git is designed for speed and efficiency, allowing for quick branching, merging, and committing of changes. Its lightweight branching model enables developers to experiment with new features without impacting the main 
                                    codebase.</li>
                                    <li><b>Branching and Merging:</b> Git's branching and merging capabilities are robust, allowing teams to work on multiple features simultaneously and merge changes back into the main codebase easily. Branches are lightweight and can be created and merged 
                                        quickly.</li>
                                        <li><b>Flexibility and Customization: </b> provides a flexible workflow that can be customized to suit the needs of different projects and teams. Users can define their branching strategies, workflows, and access controls to meet specific 
                                            requirements.</li>
                                            <li><b>Visibility and Transparency:</b> GitHub enhances the visibility and transparency of projects by providing a centralized platform for hosting code repositories. Developers can easily browse code, track changes, and contribute to open-source projects, fostering transparency and encouraging 
                                                collaboration.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

    <h2>Initializing Git Repository</h2>
    <p>A  Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. It is a crucial component of the Git version control system, which enables collaborative development and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. Git repositories are widely used in software development, where they facilitate efficient and controlled code management</p>
    <h3>How to imitialize a git repository</h3>
    <p>Run the command:
        <pre>

    <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p>A  staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. </p>
    <p><u>Process of adding files to the staging area</u>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Check status of your repository by running 
            <pre>
                git status
            </pre>

        <li><b>Add files to the staging area</b> 
            <p>-For individual files, run
                <pre>
                    git add <i>filename</i>
                </pre>
                <img src="./assets/git_add_filename.png" alt="run git add 'filename' on your cmd">
                <p><i>Adding individual files to staging area</i></p>
            </p> 
            <p>-For all files in the current repository, run the command:
                <pre>
                    git add .
                </pre>
                <img src="./assets/git_add.png" alt="run git add . in the cmd">
                <p><i>Adding all files in the Current repository</i></p>
                <p>-For all files in the entire repository,run the command:
                    <pre>
                        git add --all
                    </pre>
                    <img src="./assets/git_add_all.png" alt="Run git add --all in your cmd">
                    <p><i>Adding all files in the entire repository</i></p>
                </p>
            </p>           
        </li>
        <li><b>confirm that the files have been staged.</b> Staged files will be listed under "Changes to be committed."<br>
        Run the command:
    <pre>
        git status
    </pre>
<img src="./assets/git_status.png" alt="run git status on your cmd">
<p><i>Confirming that files have been staged</i></p>
</li>
    </0l>
    </p>
    <h3><u>Differences between tracked and untracked files</u> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Presence in Version Control: Tracked files are part of the version control system and have been included in the repository's history, while untracked files are not part of version control and have not been added to the repository.</li>
        <li>Monitoring of Changes: Git actively monitors changes to tracked files, while untracked files are not monitored by Git until they are explicitly added to the repository.</li>
        <li>Visibility in Commands: Tracked files appear in the output of commands like git status and git diff, whereas untracked files are specifically listed as "Untracked files" in git status output.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div commiting changes>
    <h2>Commiting Changes</h2>
    <p>Once you've added all the desired changes to the staging area, you can commit them to the repository.<br>
    Use the command:
<pre>
    git commit -m "your commit message"
</pre>
<img src="./assets/git_commit.png" alt="run git commit -m 'your commit message'">
<p><i>Commiting changes  to the repository</i></p>
</p>
<p><u>How to write good commit messages</u><br>
1.Aim for concise commit messages that are no longer than 50-72 characters for the subject line.<br>
2.Separate Subject and Body: If your commit message requires more explanation, separate the subject line from the body with a blank line. <br>
3.Be Specific: Provide specific details about the changes you've made, including any relevant context or reasoning behind the change. <br>
4.Use Present Tense for Subject Line, Past Tense for Body: Start the subject line with a present-tense verb
</p>
<p><u>How to view past commits</u><br>
Run the command:
<pre>
    git log
    </pre>
    <img src="./assets/git_log.png" alt="run git log">
    <p><i>How to view past commits</i></p>

  </div>
  <div branches>
    <h2>what branches in git are</h2>
    <p>In Git, branches are essentially pointers to a specific commit in the repository's history. They allow developers to work on different features, fixes, or versions of their code simultaneously without affecting the main or other branches.</p>
    <h2> why Branches are important.</h2>
    <p>1.<b>Isolation of Work:</b>Branches allow developers to isolate their work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments.<br>
    2.<b>Feature Development: </b>Feature branches provide a structured way to develop new features or enhancements.<br>
3.<b>Release Management: </b> Branches play a crucial role in release management. Release branches can be created to stabilize and prepare the codebase for a new release. <br>
4.<b>Code Reviews and Testing: </b> Branches facilitate code reviews and testing processes. Pull requests or merge requests are typically used to propose changes from one branch to another, allowing team members to review code, provide feedback, and ensure the quality of changes before they are merged into the main codebase.</p>
  </div>
  <div Creating a branch>
    <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>To create a new branch in Git,run the command:
        <pre>
